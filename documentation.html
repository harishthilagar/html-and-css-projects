        <p>Python is a high-level scripting language which can be used for a wide variety
of text processing, system administration and internet-related tasks. Unlike
many similar languages, it’s core language is very small and easy to master, while allowing the addition of modules to perform a virtually limitless
variety of tasks. Python is a true object-oriented language, and is available
on a wide variety of platforms. There’s even a python interpreter written
entirely in Java, further enhancing python’s position as an excellent solution
for internet-based problems.

      <header id="sconstant">STRING CONSTANTS</header>
      <article>
        <p>Strings are a collection of characters which are stored together to represent
arbitrary text inside a python program. You can create a  string constant   
inside a python program by surrounding text with either single quotes (’),
double quotes ("), or a collection of three of either types of quotes (’’’ or
"""). In the first two cases, the opening and closing quotes must appear on
the same line in your program; when you use triple quotes, your text can
span as many lines as you like. The choice of which quote symbol to use is
up to you – both single and double quotes have the same meaning in python.
Here are a few examples of how to create a string constant and assign its
value to a variable:
        </p>
        <div class="box1">
        <code >
          name = ’Phil’<br>
value = "$7.00"<br>
helptext = """You can create long strings of text<br>
spanning several lines by using triple quotes at<br>
the beginning and end of the text"""<br>

        <header id="list">LIST DATA</header>
      <article>  
      <p>Lists provide a general mechanism for storing a collection of objects indexed
by a number in python. The elements of the list are arbitrary — they can be
numbers, strings, functions, user-defined objects or even other lists, making
complex data structures very simple to express in python. You can input a
list to the python interpreter by surrounding a comma separated list of the
objects you want in the list with square brackets ([ ]) Thus, a simple list of
numbers can be created as follows:</p>
        <div class="box1">
          <code>>>> mylist = [1,7,9, 13, 22, 31]</code>
        </div>

        <header id="tubles">TUBLES OBJECT</header>
       <article> 
      <p>Tuples are very much like lists, except for one important difference. While
lists are mutable, tuples, like strings, are not. This means that, once a tuple
is created, its elements can’t be modified in place. Knowing that a tuple is
immutable, python can be more efficient in manipulating tuples than lists,
whose contents can change at any time, so when you know you won’t need
to change the elements within a sequence, it may be more efficient to use a
tuple instead of a list. In addition, there are a number of situations (argument
        passing and string formatting for example) where tuples are required.</p>
         <div class="box1">
           <code>
             >>> v = (7,10,12,19,8,10,4,13,10)<br>
>>> v.count(10)<br>
Traceback (innermost last):<br>
File "stdin", line 1, in ?<br>
AttributeError: ’tuple’ object has no attribute ’count’

      <header id="assignments">ASSIGNMENTS</header>
      <article>
        <p>One of the basic operations in any computer language is the assignment
statement. The assignment statement allows us to associate a variable name
with a value, so we can more easily manipulate our data. In python, like many
other languages, the equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable; the
variable name is put on the left hand side of the equal sign, and the value
(any valid python expression) is put on the right hand side  of the equal sign.
Some simple examples of assignment statements follow:
</p>
        <div class="box1">
          <code>
            >>> x = 3<br>
>>> y = ’This is a string’<br>
>>> z = x + 3<br>
>>> y = abs(-7)<br>
>>> vegies = [’broccoli’,’peas’,’carrots’]<br>
>>> meal = vegies

      <header id="ifs">IF STATEMENT</header>
      <article>
        <p>The if statement, along with optional elif and/or else statements is the
basic tool in python for performing conditional execution. The basic form of
the statement can be summarized as:
</p>
        <div class="box1">
          <code>
           if expression :
statement(s)<br>
            elif expression:
statement(s)<br>
elif expression:
statement(s)<br>

else:

      <header id="for">for loops</header>
       <article>
         <p>The for loop allows you to iterate over all the values in a sequence (string,
list or tuple), performing the same task on each of the elements. In addition,
starting with version 2.0, it’s possible to iterate over other objects, such as
file objects or dictionaries. The basic form of the for loop is:
</p>
         <div class="box1">
           <code>
             for var in sequence:<br>
statements<br>
else:<br>
statements<br>

      <header id="while">while loops</header>
      <article>
        <p>While the for loop provides an excellent way to process the elements of a
sequence, there are times when it’s necessary to do some repetitive computation which is not based on an array. In those cases, the while loop can be
used. The basic syntax of the while loop is as follows:</p>
      <div class="box1">
        <code>
          while expression:
statements
else:
statements
        </code>

      <section>
        <header id="func">FUNCTIONS</header>
        <article>
          <p>The def statement is the signal to Python that you’re about to define a
function. You follow the keyword def with the name of the function you’re
defining, and a parenthesized list of the arguments which are to be passed
to a function. If your function does not accept any arguments, then simply
use an empty set of parentheses. A colon (:) follows the parenthesized list.
The remainder of the function needs to be indented similarly to the body
of a loop (Section 6.2). If the very next line of your function definition is a
quoted string, it’s stored along with your function to provide documentation
about the function; such a string is called a docstring. The function body
follows the def line and the optional docstring. The function will return
control to the calling environment when it encounters a return statement,
or when it reaches the end of the indented function body, whichever comes
first. If an expression appears after the return statement and on the same
line, the value of that expression is returned through a call to the function.
If no expression appears on the same line as the return statement, or the
function does not contain a return statement, a call to such a function will
return the value of None.
You can access the docstring of a function by refering to the __doc__
attribute, or by passing the name of the function to the help function when
running python interactively. In addition, some python-aware editors will
display the docstring as a tool tip when you move your cursor over the
function’s name in your program</p>

        <header id="excep">EXCEPTIONS</header>
        <article>
          <p>One of the basic principles of Python mentioned in Chapter 1 was the idea
of exception handling. Unlike many languages, which leave the business
of error handling to the programmer using the language, Python handles
errors in a consistent way – when an error is encountered, Python prints
a descriptive message, and terminates execution. But beyond this default
behaviour, Python provides a simple way to trap these errors and either
ignore them, fix them, or decide that program termination really is the best
idea. The basic notion of the try/except clause has already been introduced;
in this chapter we’ll discuss its use more thoroughly, as well as look at how
to create new exceptions, and how to raise exceptions within your programs.</p>
